# Shanghai-Library-Contest

I Created a website (fuyi-yang.github.io/Shanghai-Library-Contest/) displaying historical buildings in Shanghai. The website integrates a map API and translation capabilities to spread information about the buildingsâ€™ architecture and history internationally.
I managed the front-end logic of the website, integrating Javascript with HTML.
Together, we organized 1000 building data into text files to display on the webpage.
